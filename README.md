# Tinytorch

Tinytorch is a lightweight implementation of PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. It provides a simplified version of key functionality found in PyTorch, allowing users to understand the underlying concepts and build basic neural networks. It borrows ideas and implementations from Andrej Karpathy's youtube lecture on Micrograd.

## Features

- Tensor operations: Perform mathematical operations on multi-dimensional arrays. ✅
- Automatic differentiation: Track gradients and perform backpropagation. ✅
- Optimizer classes for carrying gradient descent and other optmization techniques. ✅
- Basic loss calculation, NLL loss, MSE loss, CrossEntropy loss and such. ✅
- Basic neural network modules: Implement layers such as Linear, ReLU, and CrossEntropyLoss. (tbd)
- Data management in batches, data module setup. (tbd)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or above
- Numpy 1.24 or above
