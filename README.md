# Tinytorch

Mini-PyTorch is a lightweight implementation of PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. It provides a simplified version of key functionality found in PyTorch, allowing users to understand the underlying concepts and build basic neural networks.

## Features

- Tensor operations: Perform mathematical operations on multi-dimensional arrays. âœ…
- Automatic differentiation: Track gradients and perform backpropagation for gradient-based optimization. (tbd)
- Basic neural network modules: Implement layers such as Linear, ReLU, and CrossEntropyLoss. (tbd)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or above
- Numpy 1.24 or above
